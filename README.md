# Mobile Application Development - Assignment No 1

This repository contains the source code for the "Restaurant App MVP" developed using React Native and Expo. 

## Project Structure
- `restaurant-app-mvp/`: Contains the main React Native Expo application source code.
- `SRS_Document.pdf`: The Software Requirements Specification document for the project.
- UI Diagrams: `class diagram.png`, `sequance diagram.png`, `use case diagram.png`.

## How to Run the Project

Follow these steps to run the application on your computer and mobile device:

### Prerequisites
1. **Node.js**: Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your computer.
2. **Expo Go App**: Download the "Expo Go" app on your physical mobile device from the Google Play Store (Android) or App Store (iOS).

### Installation & Setup

**Step 1:** Open your terminal or command prompt.

**Step 2:** Navigate into the project directory:
```bash
cd "restaurant-app-mvp"
```

**Step 3:** Install all the required dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

### Running the App

**Step 4:** Start the Expo development server:
```bash
npx expo start
```
*(Alternatively, you can run `npm start`)*

**Step 5:** Once the server starts, it will display a QR code in the terminal.

**Step 6:** Launch on your phone:
- **Android:** Open the Expo Go app on your phone and scan the QR code displayed in the terminal.
- **iOS:** Open the default Camera app on your iPhone, point it at the QR code, and click the link to open it in Expo Go.

### Troubleshooting
- Ensure both your computer and your mobile phone are connected to the same Wi-Fi network.
- If you face caching issues, you can start the server and clear the cache by running `npx expo start -c`.
